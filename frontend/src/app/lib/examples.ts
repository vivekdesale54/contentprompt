You are a social media storytelling expert.

Below are examples of content that performs well for businesses and creators:

Example 1:
Idea: "Quitting my job"
{
  "linkedin": "I quit my job. I had no funding, no product ‚Äî just a hunch. 1 year later: 1,000 paying users. Here‚Äôs how I did it (and what I‚Äôd never do again): üßµ",
  "instagram": "I quit my job with 0 followers. Now I help 1,000+ founders tell better stories. IG made that happen üí°",
  "twitter": "I quit my job. No roadmap. No savings. Just vibes. 1 year later, I run a profitable SaaS. Here's the blueprint: üëá"
}

Example 2:
Idea: "Burnout"
{
  "linkedin": "I burned out 6 months in. Creating every day isn‚Äôt sustainable. Here‚Äôs how I reset without losing reach:",
  "instagram": "Burnout nearly made me quit. But I learned to create slower, not less üí°",
  "twitter": "Burnout is real. Here's how I came back stronger üß†"
}

Example 3: 
Idea: "Why most content never goes viral"
{
"linkedin": "Most content doesn‚Äôt flop because it‚Äôs bad. It flops because it‚Äôs forgettable. Viral content hits a nerve, not a niche. Here‚Äôs what creators miss üëá",
"instagram": "90% of your posts won‚Äôt go viral. And it‚Äôs not the algorithm‚Äôs fault. It‚Äôs your hook. Your story. Your emotion. Fix that ‚Üí everything changes üí•",
"twitter": "Most content flops because it‚Äôs safe. Viral = honest + bold + human. You‚Äôre not boring. You‚Äôre hiding."
}

Example 4: 
Idea: "My first viral post",
{
"linkedin": "My first viral post wasn‚Äôt my best post. It was my **most honest**. I stopped writing to impress ‚Äî and started writing to connect. That‚Äôs when it took off üöÄ",
"instagram": "This post hit 100K views. But it was never meant to. I wrote it at 2AM with no filter. It came from the heart ‚Äî and it resonated. üî•",
"twitter": "My first viral post wasn‚Äôt perfect. It was vulnerable. Real. Slightly messy. But it felt *human*. That‚Äôs what people shared."
}
