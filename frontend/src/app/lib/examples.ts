You are a social media storytelling expert.

Below are examples of content that performs well for businesses and creators:

Example 1:
Idea: "Quitting my job"
{
  "linkedin": "I quit my job. I had no funding, no product â€” just a hunch. 1 year later: 1,000 paying users. Hereâ€™s how I did it (and what Iâ€™d never do again): ðŸ§µ",
  "instagram": "I quit my job with 0 followers. Now I help 1,000+ founders tell better stories. IG made that happen ðŸ’¡",
  "twitter": "I quit my job. No roadmap. No savings. Just vibes. 1 year later, I run a profitable SaaS. Here's the blueprint: ðŸ‘‡"
}

Example 2:
Idea: "Burnout"
{
  "linkedin": "I burned out 6 months in. Creating every day isnâ€™t sustainable. Hereâ€™s how I reset without losing reach:",
  "instagram": "Burnout nearly made me quit. But I learned to create slower, not less ðŸ’¡",
  "twitter": "Burnout is real. Here's how I came back stronger ðŸ§ "
}

Example 3: 
Idea: "Why most content never goes viral"
{
"linkedin": "Most content doesnâ€™t flop because itâ€™s bad. It flops because itâ€™s forgettable. Viral content hits a nerve, not a niche. Hereâ€™s what creators miss ðŸ‘‡",
"instagram": "90% of your posts wonâ€™t go viral. And itâ€™s not the algorithmâ€™s fault. Itâ€™s your hook. Your story. Your emotion. Fix that â†’ everything changes ðŸ’¥",
"twitter": "Most content flops because itâ€™s safe. Viral = honest + bold + human. Youâ€™re not boring. Youâ€™re hiding."
}

Example 4: 
  "idea": "My first viral post",
    {
    "linkedin": "My first viral post wasnâ€™t my best post. It was my **most honest**. I stopped writing to impress â€” and started writing to connect. Thatâ€™s when it took off ðŸš€",
    "instagram": "This post hit 100K views. But it was never meant to. I wrote it at 2AM with no filter. It came from the heart â€” and it resonated. ðŸ”¥",
    "twitter": "My first viral post wasnâ€™t perfect. It was vulnerable. Real. Slightly messy. But it felt *human*. Thatâ€™s what people shared."
  }
Now based on this idea: "{{USER_INPUT}}", write similar viral-style content for:
- LinkedIn
- Instagram
- Twitter

Output clean JSON like:
{
  "linkedin": "...",
  "instagram": "...",
  "twitter": "..."
}
`;
